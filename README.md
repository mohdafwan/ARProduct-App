## Introduction

ARProduct-App is designed to revolutionize the way users interact with products before purchasing them. By utilizing Augmented Reality, users can visualize products in their real-world environment, providing a more immersive and informative shopping experience. Whether it's furniture, electronics, or fashion items, ARProduct-App aims to bridge the gap between online shopping and the traditional retail experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built using Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter offers a rich set of customizable widgets and excellent performance.
  
- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. The backend utilizes Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, to handle routing and middleware functionality efficiently.
  
- **Database**: MongoDB is employed as the database management system. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility, scalability, and performance, making it ideal for storing and managing diverse data types.
